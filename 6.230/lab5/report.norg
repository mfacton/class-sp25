* Meeting Times
  - 03/02/2025 7:30, everyone,  4hrs
  - 03/03/2025 10:30, everyone, 6hrs

* Parts Discussed/Completed
  - Problem 4 on PSET 3
  - All lab

* Notes
  - Long/Short Ethernet CAT6 Cables
  - Ethernet charactersitic impedence 100 Ohms +/-15%
  - Frequency up to 250Mhz but higher almost always works
  - Shorter cable about 1.5ft
  - Long cable measured with ruler 10.5ft
  - Bandpass is not valid for TDR
  - Step lets us observe how the signal changes over time

* Procedure
  - Start stop freq 50khz 500Mhz
  - Set points to 114
  - Set exitation to STEP
  - Enable transform
  - Set trace format to REAL
  - Calibrate to end of short ethernet cable

* Q1
  {short_open.jpg} [Short Cable Open]
  The short cable itself is close to a perfect positive (+1) step response with no delay.
  {long_open.jpg} [Long Cable Open]
  The long calbe itself is close to a perfect positive (+1) step response with the delay of the extra length.
  This makes sense because the cable itself is open for both cables, the only difference is the delay.
  It also makes sense that the reflection coefficient is close to 1 because its an open reflection

* Q2
  Propegation speed is around 70% of c (speed of light)
  This is because of the permitivity of the material (epsilon)
  Delay to slope is 23ns
  Round trip = 23ns * 0.7 * c = 4.8m
  Single trip = 2.4m = 7.9ft
  We add the length of the short cable because of the location of our calibration to get length = 9.4ft

  In reality this is a bit shorter than the actual cable length but this is probably because our cable has slightly
  more velocity factor (maybe 0.75) than what wikepedia says.
  This means in reality our cable has slightly less permittivity than the wikipedia ones.

* Q3
  {long_open.jpg} [Long Cable Open]
  For open, it delays then goes to reflection coefficient 1
  {long_short.jpg} [Long Cable Short]
  For short, it delays then goes to reflection coefficient -1
  {long_match.jpg} [Long Cable Match]
  For matched, it stays at roughly reflection coeffecient 0
  {long_r1.jpg} [Long Cable R1]
  For R1, it still reflects at the same time delay, however to coefficient of 0.38, not 1

  Yes this matches our expectations
  $Î“ = 0.38 = (Z_L - Z_0)/(Z_L + Z_0)$
  $Z_0 = 100$
  $0.38*Z_L + 0.38*Z_0 = Z_L - Z_0$
  0.62*Z_L = 1.38*Z_0
  Z_L = 2.23*Z_0
  Z_L = 223 Ohm

  I think the precision of the measurement is not to great and between me and my teammate we got a variance of 5%
  I think this is because our cables have slightly different impedences as well as the descretation of frequencies
  sent out the vna makes the measurements a bit off, and also probably the soldering too.
  This makes me think the accuracy of the measurement is somewhere 5-15%

* Q4
** L4
    {long_l4.jpg} [Long Cable L4]
    P1: 25.6ns, 0.6
    $Difference left = 1.55$
    $1 Tau of decay ~= 0.6 - 0.63*1.55 = -0.38$
    P2: 38.8ns, -0.38
    $Tau = 36.1-25.6 = 10.5ns$
    $Tau = L/R$
    $R = Z_0 = 100 Ohm$
    $L = 13.2ns * 100 = 1.05uH$
** C1
    {long_c1.jpg} [Long Cable C1]
    P1: 25.6ns, -0.45
    $Difference left = 1.45$
    $1 Tau of decay ~= -0.45 + 0.63*1.45 = 0.46$
    P2: 37.9ns, 0.47
    $Tau = 37.9-25.6 = 12.3ns$
    $Tau = R*C$
    $R = Z_0 = 100 Ohm$
    $C = 13.2ns / 100Ohm = 132pF$

    We both got around 130pF which we assume to be that there is most likely around 30pF of stray capacitance
    in the ethernet connector jack itself.
    This would mean the capacitor capacitance is 100pF

* Q5
  {long_mystery.jpg} [Long Cable Mystery]
  Exponential straight from reflection time means that for the instant that $Z_C = 0$, $Z_R = Z_0$
  because no reflection step
  $Z_R = Z_0$
  P1: 23ns, 0.02
  P2: 36.1ns, 0.64
  $Tau = 13.1ns$
  $Tau = R*C$
  $R = Z_R + Z_0 = 200$
  $C = 13.1ns / 200 = 66pF$
